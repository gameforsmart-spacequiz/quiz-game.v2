# Space Quiz Game - Documentation

## Game Code Validation Enhancement

### Overview
Enhanced the game code validation system to prevent players from joining games that have been ended by the host. Previously, game codes remained valid even after the host exited, allowing players to join inactive games.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250727204115_add_finished_column.sql`
- **Added Columns**: Ensured `finished`, `is_started`, `quiz_start_time`, `countdown_start_at`, `time_limit`, `question_count` columns exist
- **Added Indexes**: Created indexes on `finished` and `is_started` for better performance

#### 2. Host-Side Status Management (`HostContent.tsx`)
- **`handleExitGame`**: Updated to set `status: "finished"` when host exits from lobby
- **`endQuiz`**: Updated to set `status: "finished"` when quiz is manually ended
- **Auto-finish Logic**: Updated to set `status: "finished"` when all players complete quiz
- **`startQuiz`**: Updated to set `status: "active"` when quiz begins

#### 3. Player-Side Validation
- **Join Dialog**: Added validation for `finished` and `status` fields
- **Wait Page**: Added checks to prevent access to ended games
- **Play Page**: Added validation to redirect players from ended games

#### 4. Error Messages
- "Game not found" - Invalid game code
- "This game has ended and is no longer available" - Game finished
- "Game not found or already started" - Game in progress

### How It Works

1. **Game Creation**: New games start with `status: "waiting"`
2. **Quiz Start**: Status changes to `status: "active"`
3. **Game End**: Status changes to `status: "finished"` and `finished: true`
4. **Validation**: Players cannot join games with `status: "finished"` or `finished: true`

### Benefits
- Prevents players from joining inactive games
- Clear error messages for different scenarios
- Consistent status management across the application
- Better user experience with immediate feedback

### Testing Steps
1. Create a new game as host
2. Share game code with players
3. Have players join successfully
4. Host exits game from lobby
5. Verify players cannot join with the same code
6. Test with different game states (waiting, playing, finished)

## Leaderboard Display Fix

### Overview
Fixed the issue where leaderboard would briefly appear when host exits the game from the lobby (before quiz starts). Now the host is redirected directly without showing the leaderboard.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Real-time Subscription Update
- **Location**: `HostContent.tsx` - Game status subscription
- **Change**: Only show leaderboard if quiz was previously started
- **Logic**: `if (payload.old.is_started)` before setting `showLeaderboard(true)`

#### 2. Initial State Management
- **Location**: `HostContent.tsx` - Game data initialization
- **Change**: Only set `showLeaderboard` to true if game was finished AND started
- **Logic**: `setShowLeaderboard(gameData.finished && gameData.is_started)`

#### 3. Exit Function Enhancement
- **Location**: `HostContent.tsx` - `handleExitGame` function
- **Change**: Added comment explaining direct navigation without leaderboard
- **Behavior**: Immediate navigation to home page

### How It Works

1. **Lobby Exit**: Host clicks "Exit Game" in lobby
2. **Database Update**: Game status set to "finished"
3. **Direct Navigation**: Host redirected immediately without leaderboard
4. **Quiz Exit**: If quiz was started, leaderboard still shows normally

### Benefits
- Cleaner user experience when exiting from lobby
- No confusing leaderboard flash
- Maintains leaderboard functionality for actual quiz endings
- Consistent behavior across different exit scenarios

### Testing Steps
1. Create a new game as host
2. Stay in lobby (don't start quiz)
3. Click "Exit Game"
4. Verify no leaderboard appears
5. Verify immediate redirect to home page
6. Test with started quiz to ensure leaderboard still works
